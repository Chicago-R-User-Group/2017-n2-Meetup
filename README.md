# Predictive Financial Analytics: Income Statement Classification & Analyzing cash flows with General Additive Models

March, 7th 2017

Mark Bennet presented “Financial Analytics with R: Prediction Using Fundamentals".
Daniel Saxton talked about “Analyzing Cash Flows Using Generalized Additive Models”.

In **Analyzing Cash Flows using General Additive Models**, Daniel Saxton showed us how he uses this often overlooked but elegant statistical learning technique to predict cash flows. Developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, GAMs can be a useful addition to the predictive modeler’s toolbox and are discussed in greater depth in chapter 7 of ISLR ([An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)). Daniel holds a PhD in Statistics from the George Mason University and is a Predictive Modeler at Braviant Holdings.

In **Financial Analytics with R: Prediction Using Fundamentals**, Mark Bennett presented the use of classification trees and recursive partitioning  to predict security prices based on corporate income statements. These methods are described in his recently published book, 
[Financial Analytics with R: Building a Laptop Laboratory for Data Science](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-econometrics-finance-and-insurance/financial-analytics-r-building-laptop-laboratory-data-science). For a more in depth treatment of the statistical techniques, Mark also suggests ISLR . Mark Bennett holds a PhD in Computer Science from UCLA, is a senior data scientist with a major investment bank, and a lecturer in the University of Iowa’s Department of Management Sciences Graduate Program in Business Analytics. He has held software positions at Argonne National Laboratory, Unisys Corporation, AT&T Bell Laboratories, Northrop Grumman, and XR Trading Securities.
