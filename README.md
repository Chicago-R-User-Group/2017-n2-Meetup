# Predictive Financial Analytics: Income Statement Classification | GAM cash flows

March, 7th 2017

Mark Bennet discusses “Financial Analytics with R: Prediction Using Fundamentals".
Daniel Saxton talks about “Analyzing Cash Flows Using Generalized Additive Models”.

In “Analyzing Cash Flows using General Additive Models”, Daniel Saxton will discuss how he uses this often overlooked but elegant statistical learning technique to predict cash flows. Developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, GAMs can be a useful addition to the predictive modeler’s toolbox and are discussed in greater depth in chapter 7 of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning".
Daniel holds a PhD in Statistics from the George Mason University and is a Predictive Modeler at Braviant Holdings.

In “Financial Analytics with R: Prediction Using Fundamentals", Mark Bennett presented the use of classification trees and recursive partitioning  to predict security prices based on corporate income statements. These methods are also described in his recently published book, 
“Financial Analytics with R: Building a Laptop Laboratory for Data Science.” For a more in depth treatment of the technique, refernce chapter 4 of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". Mark Bennett holds a PhD in Computer Science from UCLA, is a senior data scientist with a major investment bank, and a lecturer in the University of Iowa’s Department of Management Sciences Graduate Program in Business Analytics. 
He has held software positions at Argonne National Laboratory, Unisys Corporation, AT&T Bell Laboratories, Northrop Grumman, and XR Trading Securities.
